# ARKit with SceneKit

This repository contains simple applications to demonstrate principles taught in Udacity's ARKit with SceneKit course. Each application contains a starter project to be used to follow along the videos, as well as a solution project (i.e. the state of the project after following along a video).

The videos with projects are:
- [Creating a Scene](https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-ARKit-SceneKit/tree/master/creating-a-scene)
- [Lights and Shadows](https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-ARKit-SceneKit/tree/master/lights-and-shadows)
- [Coordinate Systems and Transformations](https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-ARKit-SceneKit/tree/master/coordinate-systems)
- [Bouncing Balls](https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-ARKit-SceneKit/tree/master/bouncing-balls)
